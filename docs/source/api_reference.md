# API Reference

This section lists the important classes and functions as part of the Aerial package.

## Model Module

### AutoEncoder

```python
AutoEncoder(input_dimension, feature_count, layer_dims=None)
```

Constructs an autoencoder designed for association rule mining on tabular data, based on the Neurosymbolic Association Rule Mining method.

**Parameters**:

- `input_dimension` (int): Number of input features after one-hot encoding.
- `feature_count` (int): Original number of categorical features in the dataset.
- `layer_dims` (list of int, optional): User-specified hidden layer dimensions. If not provided, the model calculates a default architecture using a logarithmic reduction strategy (base 16).

**Behavior**:

- Automatically builds an under-complete autoencoder with a bottleneck at the original feature count.
- If no layer_dims are provided, the architecture is determined by reducing the input dimension using a geometric progression and creates `log₁₆(input_dimension)` layers in total.
- Uses Xavier initialization for weights and sets all biases to zero.
- Applies Tanh activation functions between layers, except the final encoder and decoder layers.

### train

```python
train(
    transactions,
    autoencoder=None,
    noise_factor=0.5,
    lr=5e-3,
    epochs=1,
    batch_size=2,
    loss_function=torch.nn.BCELoss(),
    num_workers=1,
    layer_dims=None,
    device=None
)
```

Given a categorical tabular data in Pandas dataframe form, it one-hot encodes the data, vectorizes the one-hot encoded version by also keeping track of start and end indices of vectors per column, and then trains the AutoEncoder model using the one-hot encoded version.

If there are numerical features with less than 10 cardinality, it treats them as categorical features. If the cardinality is more than 10, then it throws an error.

**Parameters**:

- `transactions` (pd.DataFrame): Tabular input data for training.
- `autoencoder` (AutoEncoder, optional): A preconstructed autoencoder instance. If not provided, one is created automatically.
- `noise_factor` (float): Controls the amount of Gaussian noise added to inputs during training (denoising effect).
- `lr` (float): Learning rate for the Adam optimizer.
- `epochs` (int): Number of training epochs.
- `batch_size` (int): Number of samples per training batch.
- `loss_function` (torch.nn.Module): Loss function to apply (default is BCELoss).
- `num_workers` (int): Number of subprocesses used for data loading.
- `layer_dims` (list of int, optional): Custom hidden layer dimensions for autoencoder construction (if applicable).
- `device` (str): Name of the device to run the Autoencoder model on, e.g., "cuda", "cpu" etc. The device option that is set here will also be used in the rule extraction stage.

**Returns**: A trained instance of the AutoEncoder.

## Rule Extraction Module

### generate_rules

```python
generate_rules(
    autoencoder,
    features_of_interest=None,
    ant_similarity=0.5,
    cons_similarity=0.8,
    max_antecedents=2,
    target_classes=None
)
```

Extracts association rules from a trained AutoEncoder using the Aerial algorithm.

**Parameters**:

- `autoencoder` (AutoEncoder): A trained autoencoder instance.
- `features_of_interest` (list, optional): only look for rules that have these features of interest on the antecedent side. Accepted form `["feature1", "feature2", {"feature3": "value1"}, ...]`, either a feature name as str, or specific value of a feature in object form
- `ant_similarity` (float, optional): Minimum similarity threshold for an antecedent to be considered frequent. Default=0.5
- `cons_similarity` (float, optional): Minimum probability threshold for a feature to qualify as a rule consequent. Default=0.8
- `max_antecedents` (int, optional): Maximum number of features allowed in the rule antecedent. Default=2
- `target_classes` (list, optional): When set, restricts rule consequents to the specified class(es) (constraint-based rule mining). The format of the list is same as the list format of `features_of_interest`.

**Returns**:

A list of extracted rules in the form:

```python
[
    {"antecedents": [...], "consequent": ...},
    ...
]
```

### generate_frequent_itemsets

```python
generate_frequent_itemsets(
    autoencoder,
    features_of_interest=None,
    similarity=0.5,
    max_length=2
)
```

Generates frequent itemsets from a trained AutoEncoder using the same Aerial+ mechanism.

**Parameters**:

- `autoencoder` (AutoEncoder): A trained autoencoder instance.
- `features_of_interest` (list, Optional): only look for rules that have these features of interest on the antecedent side. Accepted form `["feature1", "feature2", {"feature3": "value1"}, ...]`, either a feature name as str, or specific value of a feature in object form
- `similarity` (float, Optional): Minimum similarity threshold for an itemset to be considered frequent. Default=0.8
- `max_length` (int, Optional): Maximum number of items in each itemset. Default=2

**Returns**:

A list of frequent itemsets, where each itemset is a list of string features:

```python
[
    [...],  # e.g., ['gender=Male', 'income=High']
    ...
]
```

## Rule Quality Module

### calculate_basic_rule_stats

```python

### calculate_freq_item_support

```python

**Parameters**:

- `freq_items`: List of itemsets (list of strings in "feature__value" format).
- `transactions`: A pandas DataFrame of categorical data.
